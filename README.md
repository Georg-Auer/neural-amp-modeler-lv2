# neural-amp-modeler-lv2

Bare-bones implementation of [Neural Amp Modeler](https://github.com/sdatkinson/neural-amp-modeler) (NAM) models in an LV2 plugin.

**There is no user interface**. Setting the model to use requires that your LV2 host supports atom:Path parameters. Reaper does not. Carla and Ardour do. If your favorite LV2 host does not support atom:Path, let them know you want it. A Reaper feature request for this is [here](https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?p=2505988).

To get the intended behavior, **you must run your audio host at the same sample rate the model was trained at** (usually 48kHz) - no resampling is done by the plugin.

For amp-only models (the most typical), **you will need to run an impulse reponse after this plugin** to model the cabinet.

### Compiling

First clone the repository:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules -j4 https://github.com/mikeoliphant/neural-amp-modeler-lv2
cd neural-amp-modeler-lv2/build
```

Then compile the plugin using:

**Linux/MacOS**
```bash
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Release"
make -j4
```

**Windows**
```bash
cmake.exe -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 ..
cmake --build . --config=release -j4
```

Note - you'll have to change the Visual Studio version if you are using a different one.

After building, the plugin will be in **build/neural_amp_modeler.lv2**.
